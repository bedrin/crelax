{"name":"Crelax","tagline":"Modelling defects in crystal lattices","body":"CRelax\r\n======\r\n[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/bedrin/github/crelax/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/bedrin/github/crelax/_latestVersion)\r\n\r\nModelling point defects in crystal BCC and FCC lattices using pair-wise potentials or embedded atom model\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n======\r\n\r\n- [LatticeRelaxation.exe](https://github.com/bedrin/crelax/releases/download/1.0.0/LatticeRelaxation.exe)\r\n- [potentials.zip](https://github.com/bedrin/crelax/releases/download/1.0.0/potentials.zip)\r\n\r\nCRelax is a single `LatticeRelaxation.exe` file - just download it from [github](https://github.com/bedrin/crelax/releases/download/1.0.0/LatticeRelaxation.exe) or [bintray](https://bintray.com/artifact/download/bedrin/github/LatticeRelaxation.exe) official mirror and execute.\r\nIt is tested on Windows XP and Windows 7, but should work on Vista and 8. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported\r\n\r\nYou can also download some sample potentials data - there're Johnson pair-wise potential for FeFe and also embedded atom potentials for FeFe and FeP lattices. An archive `potentials.zip` is also availabl both on [github](https://github.com/bedrin/crelax/releases/download/1.0.0/potentials.zip) and [bintray](https://bintray.com/artifact/download/bedrin/github/potentials.zip) official mirror\r\n\r\nUsage: vacancy in Î±-Fe (Johnson potential)\r\n======\r\n\r\nLet's calculate the relaxation energy after introducing a vacancy in BCC iron using pair-wise potential\r\n\r\nStart CRelax and generate a BCC lattice. Default settings will work:\r\n\r\n![Generate Lattice](https://bedrin.github.io/crelax/images/generatelattice.png \"Generate Lattice\")\r\n\r\nSelect one atom - it will be highlighted with green; you can see the coordinate (in lattice parameters) in the right bottom corner. Let us select atom (0.5, 0.5, 0.5):\r\n\r\n![Selected Atom](https://bedrin.github.io/crelax/images/selectedatom.png \"Selected Atom\")\r\n\r\nClick on (X) icon in toolbar and remove the atom. This is how vacancies are introduced.\r\n\r\nNow open potentials dialog using main menu item `Potentials/Select Potential`\r\nAnd select Johnson potential `jFeFe.pt` for Fe-Fe pair:\r\n\r\n![Pair Potential](https://bedrin.github.io/crelax/images/pairpotential.png \"Pair Potential\")\r\n\r\nClick on play icon in Toolbar - observer the atoms are moving until the reach the equilibrium positions.\r\nOnce simulation is finished, you'll see a results dialog:\r\n\r\n![Relaxation Result](https://bedrin.github.io/crelax/images/relaxationresult.png \"Relaxation Result\")\r\n\r\nYou can use your mouse to rotate the lattice, press ALT+Mouse and PageUp/PageDown to move the \"camera\"\r\nNow you can see that atoms have shifted after relaxation of the lattice with a vacancy:\r\n\r\n![Relaxed Lattice With Vacancy](https://bedrin.github.io/crelax/images/relaxedvacancy.png \"Relaxed Lattice With Vacancy\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
